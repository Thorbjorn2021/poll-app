## Technical problems

I don't have much experience handling state (e.g. where should the state belong) and implementing API calls, so it was challenging and some problems remains unsolved. But working with a test stub for the polldata made implementation of the layout components easier.

## Pending issues
- Styling of UI
- Did not finish handling of the returned poll from the api call
- Can't make a vote
- Did not attempt at step 5-6
